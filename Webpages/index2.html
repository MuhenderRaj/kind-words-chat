<head><!--what are we doing here?-- 
          I found some code online that should help with our project. It essentially provides the images and the website design for us.oh ok
        does it work? I think it does. We'll modify the code as necessary to fit our own project' 
        are we using react here? I believe so. Shouldn't we first set it up or something? %PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json doesn't exist
         Oh never mind then. I think we should go back to our original plan. 

          We should delete this html file since it's of no use right now.'

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
